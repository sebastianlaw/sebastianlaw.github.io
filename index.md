## About Me

My name is Sebastian Law and I am a recent graduate from Seattle University where I earned by B.S. in Computer Science. While at Seattle University, I was a Division 1 student-athelete on the Track and Field team. I want to apply my degree to the interdisciplinary research of Computer Science and Biomedical devices, specifically working with the development of prosthetics and/or BCIs. I plan to pursue a PhD in this area of research.
