title: Week 9
---

I spent this week creating a knittied pressure sensor for the circuit board and testing the swatch trace prototypes I created the week before. On Monday I created the code for the knittied sensor basing the design off a knitted sensor created in a previous paper called Knit UI and it came out pretty well.

On Tuesday I met with Dr. Hofmann and she showed me how I could test the conductive traces on the swatches for the circuit board. I spent the rest of day testing them where I encountered some issues with the resistivity of them.

On Wednesday I started to problem solve the issues with the conductive traces I was having the day before by kntting with more courses of the conductive yarn and then also trying to knit them with two conductive yarns at one time which ended up fixing the issues I was having the day before.

On Thursday I met with the PhD student who's leading the swap merge project and he showed me how to test the knitted sensor using an microcontroller. We weren't getting great readings with the knittied sensor but after recreating it by knitting with two strands of conductive yarn at one time it worked really well.

On Friday I mainly spent the day finishing up knitting the final designs for the different coductive trace swatches and knitted sensor for the circuit board demo.
