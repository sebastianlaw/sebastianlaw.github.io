This week I  worked on finishing the design and prototype swatches for the custom circuit board demo which will be the third and final demo for the swatch merge project and finished the last aspect of the generalized maze code that will allow for holes on the sides and top to be created. On Monday I worked on updating the maze code and finished the design ideas for the circuit board demo.

On Tuesday I met with Dr. Hofmann for our weekly advising meeting and talked to her about my ideas for the circuit board demo and she helped me with how to knit conductive traces using the conductive yarn on the machine. We also discussed about focusing my work more on the swatch megre project and putting a hold on the knitt stim project I started the summer on because we wouldn't have enough time to conduct a user study before the CHI deadline in September. I then spent the rest of the day starting to write the code for the swatches with the conductive traces.

On Wednesday I finished the updated code for the maze and knittied prototypes to make sure it works as intended. On Thursday and Friday I finished up all the code for the different conductive traces for the circuit board and began knitting prototype swatches for each of them.
