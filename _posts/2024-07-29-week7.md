This week I mainly spent time continuing my work on the code for all the swatch samples for the benchmarks of the project and also began working on the design of the stim board example that we will use for one of the three demos for the project. On Monday and Tuesday I worked on finishing all the code for the swatches for the benchmarks and knitting samples of them on the machine.

On Wednesday I worked on creating/designing the swatches for the stim board demo. During this process, I created a swatch that mimics the bubble pop  stim toy using a knitting technique called short rows which I was really happy about how it turned out. 

On Thursday we had our summer HCC community retreat where I got to hear about all the research that the other faculity and PhD students are working on and got to meet some of the other PhD students at Northeastern in the HCC field which was a lot of fun. After, I finished designing the swatches for the stim board demo. 

On Friday I wrote the code for the swtaches for the stim board demo and knitted prototypes for each of them. Then I spent the rest of the day creating camera ready samples of each the swatches for the different benchmarks and the maze and stim board demos by adding a cast off to the end of each sample. Then I finished the day by setting up each sample to take pictures of them that will be later used in the swatch merge paper.
