title: Week 6
---
I spent most of this week working on creating and designing the benchmarks for the the swatch merge project. On Monday, I continued working on the brainstorming and writing of the descriptions for the benchmarks. By the end of the day, I had come up ideas for ten different benchmarks and three different demos for the project.

On Tuesday, I started the morning by finishing the last couple descriptions for the benchmarks before I met with Dr. Hofmann for our weekly advising meeting where I told her about my ideas for the benchmarks and demos and showed her the corresponding descriptions. I spent the rest of the day starting to write up code for the different swatches for each of the benchmarks.

The rest of the week I continued writing code for the different swatches for the benchmarks and creating sample prototypes on the knitting machine. 

During the weekend, I saw my friend from home who was visiting again and then on Sunday went to the Redsox vs Yankees game which was a lot of fun!
